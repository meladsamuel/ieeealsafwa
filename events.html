                    How old are you imagining that robots can take the place of a person? <br>
                    Did you imagine that you could leave you sitting at home and work as your place and in the best quality? <br>
                    The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence already will occupy jobs in the future,
                    and the reason is that they have the ability to be from Data,
                    they take it from the net, they expect what will happen and they will do the same functions of man and even with better accuracy.
                    Among the strongest reasons as well is that the machine is the one who learns itself without the intervention of the human being.
                    In the future, the function of the human being will be directed more in the field of programming, as it develops and continues only.
                    The domain will increase day by day, and we have decided that we are working in a shop to know people more about the field.
                    The hip shop has a duration of five days only
                     And the price: fifty pounds for five days
